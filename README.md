Frontend is tested by hand or if we have time, we use robot framework 
for automated tests

Testing will be done in every step of implementation and can be seen in schedule. We have reserved also week 4 and week 7 for testing.

6. Risk Analysis
----------------
Week 4 is reserved for security proofing. We are concentrated to prevent manipulating scrores in games, getting games without payment and profile security.
